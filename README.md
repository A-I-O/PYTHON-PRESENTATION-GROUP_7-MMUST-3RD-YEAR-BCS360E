# PYTHON PRESENTATION GROUP_7 MMUST 3RD YEAR BCS360E
 A writeup on the Java nested brackets assignment and the baseball scorekeeping task and the python codes for each.
## Baseball Scorekeeping
The program allows the scorekeeper to enter baseball game scores after every round and they are all put in a list and generated as a final score. If the scorekeeper enters the wrong datatype, the he is AUTOMATICALLY asked to enter score again. If players finish the game midway, the program terminates AUTOMATICALLY. In the program is a primitive use of AI and GUI notable by how interactive it is. Quite a fascinating and flawless piece of code by our team in Group 7. We're esteemed to invite you to try it out.
## Java Brackets Nesting
The second program walks over a non-predefined piece of java code and determines whether the code has been nested correctly. It is efficient and workable in all cases as far as java programming syntax is concerned. There are pieces of code in the program that specifically deal with loopholes.
